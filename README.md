# News2Change
News2Change identifies news trends happening near you and across the country in a few clicks. Local representatives are also shown to make advocacy more accessible. 

In my team, I was responsible for the backend of the website News2Change, which I coded in JavaScript using Node.js. I used Handlebars to display the frontend.

I used the Civic Information API to display the user's representatives by their address from Geocodio. Each representative's party affiliation, a picture, and contact information are displayed.
